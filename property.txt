### "Crisis Judo"
- **Name:** Humana Beats
- **Description:** An early-stage / borderline imaginary with a friend / musician / pro skater / madman. Incentivizes both creators and listeners to share and stream by levying a tax on their social media posts. It leverages the inherent narcissism of artists and the loud signal of virtue in the marketplace to bring money to charitable organizations. If the song isn't to a listener's liking, they can still tweet about the charitable cause they just championed in a matter of seconds. There are no losers here and that's not up for debate.
- **Dates:** 2 years of "show me a napkin drawing i'll give you code ;)" - foreva eva?
